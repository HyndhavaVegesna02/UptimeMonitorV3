# Working Agreements
# Append-only. Each entry: date, the agreement, and the incident that motivated it.
# These bind every session and every subagent brief.
# Team-proposed amendments enter only via retro with PO approval.
# PO-stated rules (coding style, conventions, process preferences) are appended
# IMMEDIATELY whenever the PO states them — the PO never waits for a ceremony.
# PO-stated rules outrank observed codebase patterns wherever they conflict.

## Defaults (active from inception)
- 2026-01-01 — Execution pipeline: stories of 1-2 points use implementer + DoD gate;
  3+ points use implementer + spec reviewer + quality reviewer + DoD gate.
  The DoD gate is never skipped at any size. (Default)
- 2026-01-01 — Effort cap: a story exceeding 3x its estimate in attempts is
  auto-Blocked with a summary of what was tried. (Default)
- 2026-01-01 — An 8-point story must be split during refinement; it may never
  enter a sprint. (Default)
- 2026-01-01 — Tooling (MCP servers, CLIs) may only change at sprint planning or
  retro; mid-sprint the environment is frozen like scope. (Default)
- 2026-01-01 — One active session: honor .scrum/session.lock; a second session
  runs read-only. (Default)

## PO working agreements (locked at inception, 2026-06-23 — from YOURTEAM_INCEPTION.md §7)
- 2026-06-23 — **The dossier is the spec.** Every subagent brief cites the relevant
  section of `uptime-monitor-v3-design.html`. Implementers build to the dossier + the
  story AC, never to chat history.
- 2026-06-23 — **Boundary violations are build failures, not review comments.** If
  `lint-imports` (import-linter) or the schema FK-direction check goes red, the story
  is NOT Done — no human override, at any story size.
- 2026-06-23 — **Pure core, mockable edges.** No story in zones 1–4 may require live
  Dynatrace / Statuspage / Neon to pass its tests. Core logic is tested with in-memory
  canonical fixtures; ports are mocked/faked. Real adapters are their own zones and use
  recorded fixtures + a throwaway test database.
- 2026-06-23 — **Measure before optimizing the read path.** The derive-on-read strategy
  ships as-is; availability/status are never persisted. No caching story is created until
  a measurement story demonstrates a real 30-day multi-location read problem.
- 2026-06-23 — **Defer auth cleanly.** Auth's absence never blocks a story. From the
  deployment story onward, CORS is restricted to the Vercel origin (+ localhost for dev).
